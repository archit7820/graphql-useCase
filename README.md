# graphql-useCase
# This is basic implementation of Graphql in our react project where we create data sets TODOS and USERS 
# we fetch our data from the server files using graphql so that we only get the demanded or usefull data not all the data 
#  we also use apollo server in our localhost8000/graphql port we  check the data fetching using single call of  2  API's
